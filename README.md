# Autonomy Canvas
The team autonomy canvas, a tool to help teams to move forward when they are at a stage of conflict and counter-dependecy.

## About it
The canvas consists of 7 sections with essential topics to be discussed by the team. During the session, participants should be generous with their words and attitudes and always looking from the "I" perspective to make it a safe space for discussion. This canvas is based on [theteamcanvas.com](theteamcanvas.com) and also on the [Integrative Model of Group Development](https://www.hyperisland.com/blog/creating-effective-teams-the-detailed-curation), developed by Susan Wheelan, this is the output from the Managing Projects and Teams from the Master's on Digital Management at Hyper Island.
